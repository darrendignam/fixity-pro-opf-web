						<p>
							AVP and the Open Preservation Foundation (OPF) are excited to announce that AVP has transferred ownership and intellectual property rights of Fixity Pro to OPF. This transfer represents our mutual commitment to ensuring the long-term sustainability and continued development of this essential digital preservation tool.
						</p>
						<p>
							Fixity has been a popular tool since its release in 2013. It has become a crucial tool for organisations of all sizes in monitoring and maintaining the integrity of their digital collections. From universities and government agencies to memory institutions and individuals, Fixity has become an integral part of a digital preservation workflow. 
						</p>
						<p>
							The transfer to the OPF is an important step in Fixity's journey. OPF will make Fixity Pro freely available as open source software and continue its development, ensuring that this valuable resource remains accessible to the digital preservation community. This aligns perfectly with the OPF's mission to advance digital preservation through collaborative, practical approaches and shared solutions.
